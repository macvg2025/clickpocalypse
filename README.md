# Clickpocalypse

**Clickpocalypse** is an **insane, over-the-top clicker game** inspired by Cookie Clicker—but turned all the way up to 11. Build minions, destroy planets, trigger random cosmic events, and unlock hundreds of achievements. Chaos has never been this satisfying.

- **Events & Random Chaos:** Random events that shake the screen, spawn particles, and trigger mini-apocalypses.
- **Achievements:** 200+ achievements including secret and prestige milestones.
- **Prestige System:** Reset progress to gain permanent multipliers and unlock ultimate chaos.
